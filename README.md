## Introduction
Currently, I am deeply fascinated by and actively working on developing gpt-based autonomous AI agents that interact with the real world. I believe that, at this time, it presents the clearest roadmap towards achieving AGI. This project is a collection of awesome projects and resources related to autonomous ai agents for everyone.
